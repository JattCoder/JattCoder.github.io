In my React Application, i worked on my portfolio with few different libraries and one of the library i used is Redux, to handle data with Back-End Rails API. 

Home Page, Welcomes users to my Portfolio, while handeling few different animations running constantly in the background - Heartbeat and Background. Every 10 Seconds, application resquests for new quote from Rails API and displays it to user right below welcome message.

Sorting Algo, Displays Array of Boxes with random size and random color to each box. User can increase or decrease the size of array using range input. after selecting the size of array, select the type of sort from drop down selection, then hit submit button to see magic happen, it will live sort the array. 

Apps, my portfolio will fetch my apps data from Rails API and display it all in card slider view, where users can slide to different page using dots or drag -> slide or using arrow buttons, with-in each card, images, information and 2 buttons of Live and Source of applications will be displayes. Live button will redirect the user to video and Source button will redirect user to github repo.

About, My information will be displayed with images of programming languages i am expert at at the bottom of page.
