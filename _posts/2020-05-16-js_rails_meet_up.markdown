In my JS Rails Application i worked on building maps, where users are capable of finding route to destination or users can build their own route to destination.

Building your own route with best route possible based on traffic. Users can build route by adding stops before getting to destination, ex: i want go get coffee, but before coffee, i want to pick-up pizza, that i ordered 20 minutes ago. My application will find best route possible, so you don't get stuck in traffic, it may have you drive through side streets, if necessary.

Other way you can modify your route if by avoiding highways, tolls or ferries and my application will still try to find the best possible route.

My application have layed out locations using Google API, users can simply click on location and get details of location or business. it will provide you with, if business is operational or closed, name of business, address, rating and how many ratings are there. users can simply click on directions or add to favorites. 

When clicked on directions, application will use your location and find a route.

When clicked on add to favorites, application will save that location to your favorites. Everytime user sign in to website or on webpage load, application will plot all of your favorite locations on map, you can click on favorite marker anytime and get directions to it and navigate to it.
