In my rails application, i have cloned few google features - Google Business, Google Maps, Google Chat and in progress Google Search. 

In Google Business, 
* Business owners around the world can add their business.
* People in your neighbourhood can see your business location on map or they can search your business on map. 
* People can see what products you have available in your business. ex Beer, Wine, Liquor, Chips and more.

You can also see other users businesses on google maps.

In Google Maps, 
*  You can simply search for location using their address or geo-coordinates points.
*  It will pot a point on map with their complete address.

In Google Chat, it is an location based chat with people in your neighbourhood.
*  If you are in Manhattan, New York, user will only have access to  open chats in Manhattan, New York.
*  User can open new topic and other users in same city will have access to user's open topic.
*  If user is using inappropritate language, user can be blocked from chat only by admin, admin have full control of chat, who can access to his/her chat and who can not have access to his/her chat.

In Google Search, 
* User can simply search in search just like using Google ex: Why use ruby on rails?
