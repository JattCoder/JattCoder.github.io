In my second project (Sinatra Application), i worked with Tesla Superchargers. In this application you can search for superchagers using City, State or ZipCode. It will give you list of all superchargers based on your search. You can search for superchargers in other countries as well, not just USA. My application have access to all of the superchargers all over the world. It will give you details (how far is supercharger, how many stalls are available at supercharger location, how much of power you can draw from each stall).

Other than searching for superchargers using (City, State or Zipcode), in this application, you can search for your route from point A to point B and it will give you list of stops and provide you best route possible with beautiful design. 

In order to search for superchargers, you must create an account and select car under account details, you will have list of Tesla Cars with their battery range. Based on selection of car(range), my app will calculate and provide you best route possible.

Happy Driving Tesla!
