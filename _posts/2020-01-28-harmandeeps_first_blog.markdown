Why did i start to learn Software Development?

I decided to become Software Developer, when i was taking courses at Cleveland State University. Before i decided to before Software Developer, i wanted to become Business Man (MBA). While taking courses for it, i felt that Business is not for me. I was totally lost to choose my Major because there are alot of Major's to choose from. Deep down in my heart i had interest in building computers ex: Buiding, Upgrading and Repairing Gaming PC's. I decided to go for Computer Engineering, even tho i knew becoming Computer Engineer is not about Building, Upgrading or Repairing PC's, i still went for it. While in Engineering School taking Circuit Board Courses, i took few coding courses (C Programming, Java, JavaScript). After few semesters, i realized my grades were very poor in Circuit Board Courses but i did very well in Coding Courses. That's when i decide to build application for Android Devices using Android Studio, from small applications i successfully build medium size applications and successfully uploaded those applications to Google Play Store and wanted to build my career becoming Software Developer.
